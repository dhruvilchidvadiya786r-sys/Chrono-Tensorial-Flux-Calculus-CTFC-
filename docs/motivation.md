This pipeline is:
- causal,
- bounded,
- interpretable,
- mathematically explicit.

No step is heuristic.

## 8. Why CTFC Produces Invariants (Not Predictions)

CTFC does **not** try to predict the future.

Instead, it produces **invariants**:
quantities that summarize system state in a stable, interpretable way.

This is intentional.

In complex systems:
- prediction is fragile,
- interpretation is durable.

CTFC provides:
- regime indicators,
- stability diagnostics,
- structural stress measures,
- latent geometric modes.

These can then be used by:
- analysts,
- decision systems,
- downstream models.

CTFC is a *representation theory*, not a forecasting engine.

## 9. Scientific Motivation (Beyond Engineering)

From a scientific perspective, CTFC addresses a deeper gap:

> There is no widely used framework for **non-Markovian geometry on
evolving manifolds** driven by observable interaction.

CTFC provides:
- a concrete mathematical formalism,
- a discrete realization,
- explicit assumptions and guarantees.

This places it closer to:
- applied mathematics,
- information geometry,
- operator-theoretic modeling,

than to ad hoc signal processing.

## 10. Why CTFC Is a Theory, Not Just Code

CTFC is accompanied by:

- an operator map,
- explicit assumptions,
- formal guarantees,
- documented failure modes.

This is deliberate.

CTFC is meant to be:
- critiqued,
- extended,
- tested,
- cited.

The code exists to **realize the theory**, not replace it.

## 11. When You Should *Not* Use CTFC

CTFC is not appropriate if:

- you only care about short-term prediction,
- geometry is irrelevant to your system,
- interpretability is not required,
- memory effects are negligible.

CTFC is intentionally opinionated.

---

## 12. Final Motivation Statement

CTFC exists because:

- correlation is geometry,
- time has memory,
- structure does not change randomly,
- and existing tools do not respect these facts simultaneously.

CTFC is an attempt to treat **time-evolving structure as a first-class
mathematical object**.

If your problem involves **structure, persistence, and interaction**,
CTFC provides a language to reason about it.
