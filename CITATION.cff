  Chrono-Tensorial Flux Calculus (CTFC) is a general mathematical and computational
  framework for modeling spatiotemporal systems with non-Markovian memory,
  spatial flux interactions, and evolving covariance geometry.
  CTFC treats covariance matrices as trajectories on a flux-deformed manifold,
  introducing chrono-operators such as flux-weighted derivatives, integral memory,
  curvature surrogates, and flux-scaled spectral modes.
  The framework provides both a continuous geometric theory and a stable
  discrete-time realization (CTFC≈), enabling interpretable, bounded, and
  reproducible analysis of complex dynamical systems.
  Applications include financial markets, neural data, physical systems,
  and any domain where temporal correlation geometry evolves over time.

    We introduce Chrono-Tensorial Flux Calculus (CTFC), a unified geometric
    framework for spatiotemporal representation learning that integrates
    temporal memory, spatial flux interactions, and curvature of evolving
    covariance structures. CTFC defines a family of chrono-operators derived
    from Volterra-type memory kernels and tensor contractions, providing
    bounded and interpretable invariants. A stable discrete-time realization
    (CTFC≈) enables robust empirical application to real-world systems such
    as financial markets and neural data.
